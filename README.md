# 📊 Traffic Accident Analysis Project

This project presents an in-depth analysis of traffic accident data to uncover patterns and correlations related to **road conditions**, **weather**, and **time of day**. The goal is to identify critical accident hotspots and highlight contributing factors to help improve traffic safety and guide data-driven decisions.

---

## 🔍 Objective

- Analyze how environmental and temporal conditions influence road accidents.
- Identify high-risk areas (accident hotspots).
- Visualize trends and patterns using graphs and geospatial plots.

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for plotting trends  
- **Folium** or **Plotly** for accident hotspot mapping  
- **Correlation analysis** to evaluate contributing factors  
- **Time-series analysis** on accidents by hour/day  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Peak accidents observed during **evening rush hours** and **rainy conditions**.
- Poor lighting and wet roads significantly increase accident probability.
- Specific locations were identified as **hotspots**, requiring infrastructure review.
